### An open-source, low-power, digital picture frame powered by a Raspberry Pi that gives images a natural aesthetic due to its E-Ink Display.

- **Web Ui**: Built-in Web UI to control PiInk and upload images over the network.
- **Low Power**: The E-Ink display does not require power to continually display images, allowing pictures on the frame to persist
- **Natural Aesthetic**: The lack of a backlight and the nature of E-Ink technology allows images displayed on PiInk to resemble images printed on paper.
- **Open Source**:
