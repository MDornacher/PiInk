### An open-source, low-power, digital picture frame that gives images a natural, paper-like, aesthetic.

**Features:**
- **Web Ui**: A built-in interface to control PiInk and upload images over the network.
- **Low Power**: The E-Ink display only needs power to change images, allowing pictures to persist on the frame.
- **Natural Aesthetic**: No backlight and the unique E-Ink technology make images look as if they are printed onto paper.
- **Open Source**: PiInk is under the MIT License, so modify it as you see fit!

## Installation

## Parts List

PiInk's 3D printed mount is tailored to fit the Raspberry Pi Zero family, but it's versatile enough to be used with any Raspberry Pi model. Here's what you'll need to build your own PiInk frame:

- **Raspberry Pi**: Purchase a Pi Zero or other Raspberry Pi model from websites like [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/category/105) or [Pimironi](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/raspberry-pi).
- **E-Ink Display**: Specific details are in the next section.
- **3D-Printed Stand**: Required for mounting the E-Ink Display.

### E-Ink Display


**PiInk uses a Pimironi Inky Impression E-Ink Display, available in 3 sizes: 4", 5.7", & 7.3" You can purchase one at the links below.**

- **[4 Inch Display](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-impression-4)**
- **[5.7 Inch Display](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-impression-5-7)**
- **[7.3 Inch Display](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-impression-7-3)**

The included mounting hardware is used to secure the Inky Impression to the 3D-printed stand.

### 3D Printed Stand

3D printable stand files for the frame are available in the [STL folder](https://github.com/tlstommy/PiInk/tree/main/STL) or on [Printables.com](). Select the appropriate stand for your E-Ink display size from the table below:
