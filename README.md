### An open-source, low-power, digital picture frame powered by a Raspberry Pi that gives images a natural aesthetic due to its E-Ink Display.

- **Web Ui**: A built-in interface to control PiInk and upload images over the network.
- **Low Power**: The E-Ink display only needs power to change images, allowing pictures to persist on the frame.
- **Natural Aesthetic**: No backlight and the unique E-Ink technology make images look as if they are printed on paper.
- **Open Source**: PiInk is under the MIT License, so modify it as you see fit!
